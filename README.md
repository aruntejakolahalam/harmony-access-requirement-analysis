# Harmony Apartments – Requirement Analysis and Database Design

## Overview
This project focuses on analysing business requirements for the Harmony Apartments system
and translating them into a structured database design. The objective is to document system
requirements, design an entity relationship model, and develop SQL queries to support data
storage, retrieval, and validation.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- Identification of entities, attributes, and relationships
- Entity Relationship (ER) diagram design
- SQL query development to support system operations
- Data integrity and logical database structure

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Word for requirements documentation
- MySQL Workbench for ER diagram design
- SQL for data definition and querying
- Relational database design principles

## Files in This Repository
- Harmony_Access_Requirement_Analysis.docx – Detailed requirements analysis document  
- Harmony_Access_SQL_Code.sql – SQL scripts and queries  
- Harmony_Apartments_ER_Diagram.mwb – ER diagram and database model  

## Key Insights
- Clear requirement definition helped identify core system entities and relationships.
- ER modelling ensured a structured and scalable database design.
- SQL queries were aligned with business requirements to support data accuracy.
- Proper normalization reduced redundancy and improved data integrity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Business and system requirements analysis
- Database modelling and ER diagram design
- SQL querying and relational thinking
- Structured documentation and analytical reasoning
